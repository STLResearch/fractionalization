# **AirRights CNFTs Fractionalization**

---

The core requirements for a fractionalization protocol designed to work with compressed NFTs for SkyTrade. The goal is to enable cNFT owners to tokenize their assets into SPL tokens (fractions), distribute rental revenue, and eventually support a trustless reclaim mechanism that respects all token holders fairly.

The protocol must operate in a decentralized, permissionless way, while remaining compatible with Metaplex standards and Solana-native primitives.

---

### **1\. Asset Locking & Fractional Tokenization**

* The protocol must allow a cNFT to be **locked in escrow while fractionalized**, held by a program-derived address (PDA).  
* Upon locking, the PDA **mints a fixed supply of SPL tokens** to represent fractional ownership of the NFT.  
* These SPL tokens ("fractions") are sent to the original NFT owner, who may freely distribute or sell them.  
* Token metadata must **maintain a reference to the original cNFT**..  
* The PDA holds **mint and burn authority**, preventing unauthorized supply changes.

### **2\. NFT Reclaim Mechanism**

* Any user holding **80% or more of the total SPL token supply** is eligible to reclaim the original NFT.

* The reclaim flow must:

  * **Burn the reclaimer’s SPL tokens**, and  
  * **Transfer the NFT** from the PDA escrow to the reclaimer’s wallet.  
  * **Compensate Minority holders (holding \<20%)** **at a fair market rate** for their invalidated tokens.  
* The reclaim price is set on-chain through a decentralized way and must reflect:

  * Historical AMM trading prices (e.g. TWAP),  
  * Rental revenue generated by the asset  
* The reclaim mechanism must be **robust against inactivity**, allowing resolution even if some holders are unreachable.

### **3\. Rental Revenue Distribution**

* The protocol must support one of two compatible revenue models:

  * **Passive Accumulation**: all rental income is stored in the PDA and automatically transferred to the NFT reclaimer along with the asset.  
  * **Active Distribution**: income is periodically distributed to SPL token holders based on **snapshot ownership data**.
